I'm a UX engineer and full-stack developer hybrid currently working at [Futurice](https://futurice.com/). I also occasionally lecture about web design at [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en). I like building stuff that people enjoy using.

On my free time I make music, ride my motorcycle and shoot photos with old cameras üì∏
