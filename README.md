🖖🏻 Hello, I'm Eetu. I'm a UX engineer and developer hybrid currently working as lead developer at Kameratori.fi. I also occasionally lecture about web design at [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en). I like building stuff that people enjoy using. 

On my free time I make music, watch lots of movies and shoot photos 📸.
